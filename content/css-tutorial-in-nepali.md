## Setting Up CSS

Before writing CSS, we need an HTML document to apply the styles. Follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor like **VS Code** or **Notepad++**.
2. Create a new file called `index.html`.
3. Write the following HTML code and save the file:
```js showLineNumbers
```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ne">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>CSS Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>नमस्ते, संसार!</h1>
</body>
</html>
